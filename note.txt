#  Session — Information pertaining to a specific user of a website
#  Cookie — File managed by the web browser that can save information from a website
Q: By default, the express-session module stores session data in the web server's RAM. Why might that be a problem?
    a: Because if  too many people log in, the session data might fill the RAM AND CRASH THE SERVER
Q: Why are session variables typically stored on the server rather than in a cookie on the browser?
    a: cookies can last longer than a session, but that age of the data in the cookie isn't important.
You wouldn't want to use a session to store all user data -- sessions don't stick around (so the data would be lost) and it's more efficient to store lots of data in a database.
